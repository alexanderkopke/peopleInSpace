Following along with The Coding Train and Shiffman proposed a small challenge to put at least the names next to the astronaut circles. One circle is randomly created for each astronaut in space. hmm yeah I think that is it. 


UPDATE: Doesn't work because github blocks it or something. I did use jsonp but meh.
